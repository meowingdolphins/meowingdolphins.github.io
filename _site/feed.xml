        <title>Project: Newsgames: Journalism at Play</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsgames: Journalism at Play, is a book written by Ian Bogost, Simon Ferrari, and Bobby Schweizer detailing the past, present, and future of newsgames, a genre of videogames focusing on journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional journalistic mediums like the newspaper and television face limitations and baked-in bias which renders it difficult to convey a raw message to the audience. A videogame, however, allows the player to experience the news first hand, whether it’s commanding a pirate crew in Cutthroat Capitalism, or a drone strike in September 12th, so that they may draw their own conclusions from objective information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book explores newsgames about current events, infographic newsgames, documentary newsgames, puzzle newsgames, literacy newsgames, and community newsgames.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Video Games Have To Teach Us About Learning And Literacy is a book by James Paul Gee which talks about the major cognitive activities including the way to develop identities, how we understand the meaning of things through semiotic, how we perceive the world, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author takes an optimistic view of video games, and also introduce a list of learning principles and how these principles can be applied to the daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: Games of Empire: Global Capitalism and Video Games</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book discusses the social effects of video games on society, with a special focus on video games as a business and corporate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covering a wide range of topics, including the history of video games, the relationship and interaction between video game and real world reality, and the nature of video game societies, the authors explore the paradoxical
nature of video games both as a creative outlet for millions around the world and a powerful business commodity and ideological tool for governments and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: Cyber-dehumanization: Violent video game play diminishes our humanity</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is a report on a study conducted to observe whether or not violent videogames result in a dehumanising effect on subjects. A reduction in “humanness” is akin to liking us to machines or animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairs of undergraduate students were pitted against each other in the fighting game Mortal Kombat, and a non-violent game Top Spin Tennis, to determine if dehumanisation occurs as a result of playing the former. An additional study was conducted with pairs playing cooperatively, using Call of Duty 2 as the violent option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results proved that players do indeed perceive their opponents as less human, and that this was independent of how enjoyable, exciting, or frustrating the game was, and also independent of self-esteem and mood.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: Cognitive enhancement in video game players: The role of video game genre</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report is based on a study that compare two group of video players (first–person shooter and real-time strategy) indicates that the cognitive abilities they have enhanced may be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result shows that real-time strategy players show superior performance through these comparison, which proves that occurrence of specific cognitive enhancement may be determined by game mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: Is there such a thing as online video game addiction? A cross-disciplinary review</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reviews a variety of literature in an attempt to determine whether video game addiction exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using existing biological, psychological and social research, the authors come to the conclusion that video game addiction exists, as video game dependency displays similar, though more mild characteristics to substance addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the unwillingness of some to consider VGA valid due to it not directly affecting the brain, the authors point out that there exist accepted indirect addictions, such as gambling addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog: Time to change your apps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/b&gt; is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. &lt;!--more--&gt;
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, &lt;b&gt;Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text&lt;/b&gt;. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Hampden-Sydney College&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-do-we-use-it&quot;&gt;Why do we use it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable.&lt;/p&gt;
