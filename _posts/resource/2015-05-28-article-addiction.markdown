####Summary
This article reviews a variety of literature in an attempt to determine whether video game addiction exists.

Using existing biological, psychological and social research, the authors come to the conclusion that video game addiction exists, as video game dependency displays similar, though more mild characteristics to substance addiction.

Addressing the unwillingness of some to consider VGA valid due to it not directly affecting the brain, the authors point out that there exist accepted indirect addictions, such as gambling addiction.
