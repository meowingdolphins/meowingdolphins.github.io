####Summary
The research group at Molecular Psychiatry aims to prove how training in videogames might make a difference in preventing mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Using the video game Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 3DS, they measured the potential of videogames to induce neurological changes. In this experiment, they used a group of university students from Germany to undergo various testing including brain scans, questionnaires, and regular gaming participation.

The results indicate that increased plasticity in areas such as the prefrontal cortex can have a dramatic effect on a person’s desire to play games, which can ultimately counteract certain mental illnesses.
