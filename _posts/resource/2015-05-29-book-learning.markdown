####Summary
This book discusses the role of videogames in major cognitive activities, including ways to develop identities, how we understand the meaning through semiotics, and how we perceive the world.

The author takes an optimistic view of video games, and also introduces a list of learning principles and explains how they can be applied to daily life.
