####Summary
The book, Philosophy Through Video Games, targets how basic philosophical theories are present within videogames.

Some key points of discussion include how the effects of gaming inside and outside the mind are interchangable, how violence in first person shooters can lead to a violent society, and how the growth of oneâ€™s personal identity can be split through massively multiplayer online role playing games.

The overarching message of this book is how videogames have the possibility of enriching our own lives as are continuously popular and that they engage with common philosophical problems.
