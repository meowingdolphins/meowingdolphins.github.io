####Summary
This report is based on a study that compares two groups of videogame players; firstâ€“person shooter and real-time strategy, as well as non videogame players, to determine whether there is a difference in cognitive enhancement between these groups.

The results show that real-time strategy players show greater cognitive ehnacement than first-person shooter players, and that both groups of gamers show superior cognitive enhancement to non-gamers. This implies that gaming has positive effects on cognitive enhancement.
