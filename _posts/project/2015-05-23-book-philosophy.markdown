####Summary
The book, Philosophy Through Video Games, targets how basic philosophical theories are present within the field of video games.

Some key points of discussion include how gaming inside and outside the mind are interchangable, how violence in first person shooters can lead to a violent society, how the growth of one’s personal identity can be split through MMORPG’s, ect.

The overarching message of this book aims to convey how video games have the possibility of enriching our own lives as are continuously popular and that they engage with common philosophical problems.
