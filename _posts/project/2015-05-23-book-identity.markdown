####Summary
This book gives a variety of ways to help understand the relationship between virtual worlds, avatars, and identity. By using case studies, literature reviews, quantitative and qualitative analyses, and personal reflections it explores the pros and cons of being virtual.

The chapters range from stating how concepts of identity can be applied and experimented with in virtual worlds, to exploring how revealing yourself through your avatar can lead to privacy risks.
