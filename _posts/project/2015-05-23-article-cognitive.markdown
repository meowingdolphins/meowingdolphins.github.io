This report is based on a study that compare two group of video players (firstâ€“person shooter and real-time strategy) indicates that the cognitive abilities they have enhanced may be different.

The result shows that real-time strategy players show superior performance through these comparison, which proves that occurrence of specific cognitive enhancement may be determined by game mechanics.
