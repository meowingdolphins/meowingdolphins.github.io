####Summary
The research group at Molecular Psychiatry aims to prove how training in video games might make a difference in preventing mental diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Using the video game, Super Mario 64 on the 3DS, they measured the effects of how video game might have the potential to induce changes into gamers. In this test case they used a group of university students from Germany to undergo various testing including brain scans, questionnaires as well as regular gaming participation.

Overall their results reflect how increased plasticity in areas such as the prefrontal cortex can have a dramatic effect on a person’s desire to play games, which can ultimately counteract certain mental diseases.
