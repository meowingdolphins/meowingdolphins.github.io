####Summary
Newsgames: Journalism at Play, is a book written by Ian Bogost, Simon Ferrari, and Bobby Schweizer detailing the past, present, and future of newsgames, a genre of videogames focusing on journalism.

Traditional journalistic mediums like the newspaper and television face limitations and baked-in bias which renders it difficult to convey a raw message to the audience. A videogame, however, allows the player to experience the news first hand, whether itâ€™s commanding a pirate crew in Cutthroat Capitalism, or a drone strike in September 12th, so that they may draw their own conclusions from objective information.

The book explores newsgames about current events, infographic newsgames, documentary newsgames, puzzle newsgames, literacy newsgames, and community newsgames.
