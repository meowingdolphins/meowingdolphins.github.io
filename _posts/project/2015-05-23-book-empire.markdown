####Summary
This book discusses the social effects of video games on society, with a special focus on video games as a business and corporate tool.

Covering a wide range of topics, including the history of video games, the relationship and interaction between video game and real world reality, and the nature of video game societies, the authors explore the paradoxical
nature of video games both as a creative outlet for millions around the world and a powerful business commodity and ideological tool for governments and corporations.
