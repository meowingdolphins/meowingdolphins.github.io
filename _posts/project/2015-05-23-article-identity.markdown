####Summary
This article researches the behaviour characteristics and motivations behind avatar creation in virtual worlds such as MMORPGs (Massively multiplayer online role playing game), or COVEs (Creativity-oriented virtual environment).

It first gives out theories and references other studies to give background to the topic in question such as the term possible selves which was coined by Markus and Nurius (1986). Possible selves is a concept that represents a person's idea of what they could become. This is one reason that could affect a person's choice on the outcome of the creation of their avatar.

Participants in the research used virtual worlds and were given an online survey to complete which asked a variety of questions that involve how the participants view their avatars.

The results of the study suggests that the avatars that the participants create do not necessarily resemble the participants themselves. Even the way the participant behaves while controlling the avatar is also not necessarily the way that the participant would behave in the real world. The study also determined four major motivations of avatar creation: virtual exploration, social navigation, contextual adaptation, and identity representation.
