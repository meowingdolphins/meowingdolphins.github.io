####Summary
The article is a report on a study conducted to observe whether or not violent videogames result in a dehumanising effect on subjects. A reduction in “humanness” is akin to liking us to machines or animals.

Pairs of undergraduate students were pitted against each other in the fighting game Mortal Kombat, and a non-violent game Top Spin Tennis, to determine if dehumanisation occurs as a result of playing the former. An additional study was conducted with pairs playing cooperatively, using Call of Duty 2 as the violent option.

The results proved that players do indeed perceive their opponents as less human, and that this was independent of how enjoyable, exciting, or frustrating the game was, and also independent of self-esteem and mood.
